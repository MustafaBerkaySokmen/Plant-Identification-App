# Plant-Identification-App
The Plant Identification App is a Flutter-based mobile application that uses the device camera and an API to identify plants from images. The app captures an image of a plant's organ (e.g., leaf) and sends it to the PlantNet API for identification, returning the scientific name of the plant.
